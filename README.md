# Overeater

**Overeater is a video game that is not finished yet, and I think it will never be actually finished.**

## Build

* On Linux, use [cmake](https://cmake.org/).

```console
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
```

* On Windows, --||--, but you will need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
* After you installed Visual Studio, you are going to open solution Overeater.sln in build folder.
* Now you are going to change from "Debug" to "Release", and then press ctrl-shift-b on the keyboard. After that you are going to get Release folder inside build folder and there is executable.
